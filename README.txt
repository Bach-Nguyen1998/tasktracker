The design of this app was very similar to that of hw 6.
The main difference between the two being the layout of the 
app itself. For example, the task page is now the first thing
that appears on a page load. This is so that the user immediately
knows what tasks they need to do. All relevant actions are stored
in the header, such as making a new user, seeing tasks (i.e. going
back to the main page), and seeing all users. The assignment of a 
user to a task is the same process as in hw 6 and 7: it is a select 
input with all the users, preventing incorrect inputs. Furthermore,
tasks can be edited in the task list itself as opposed to being 
another form. They can be marked as completed and time increments
of 15 can be added. Of course, time spent can not be negative. 
Both the title of the task and email of the user are unique indexes.
